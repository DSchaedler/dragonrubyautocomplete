However, the software is licensed under GPLv3 because it does not meet the technical definition of a library as defined under the LGPL. Please contact me for licensing if you are creating a commercial, for profit work which is not allowed under GPLv3.

Because most of The Program is just data and repackaged documentation, it can be difficult to determine what, if anything, falls under the stated copyright and license.

 * The name "DragonRuby Autocomplete".  

This does not include:
 * Configuration files, settings, System Libraries, Corresponding Source or other work which is included because it is necessary for compilation, but was not created by the author.
